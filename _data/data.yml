    - name: Master Thesis; Improving Clustering Uncertainty-weighted Embeddings for Active Domain Adaptation

      details: |
        + Proposed a loop threshold method to improve Clustering Uncertainty-weighted Embeddings.
        + Proposed an Active Domain Adaptation framework which explains the quality of uncertainty is important and compare different active learning methods.
        + Benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art methods for active learning on three different domain shift, and find that methods based on uncertainty are not reliable in the early stage for Active Domain Adaptation.
        + Show the effectiveness of our method for 3 datasets, namely, SVHN→MNIST, DomainNet, and Office-31.
